Authentication for the websockets
  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/websocket-security
  http://howtonode.org/socket-io-auth

Auth behavior
  - auto log out after... 1 day?
  - remember me
    - what exactly does this do?
    - means that you can close the browser and stay logged in
  - reset password

Do next:
  - implement signup
    - all three fields required
  - create in-memory sessions state of users
    - expire sessions periodically
  - Which actions are allowed with and without auth?
  - How does the UI change with and without auth?
  - What gets sent to the server as a token to authentication actions?
  - Add logout link
  -
  - BUG - separate login errors from signup errors
  - BUG - "room" value gets lost on invalid login/signup

Do later:
  - independent auth micro-service
  - reset password
    - sends an email to the user with a link
      - link expires after 1 day
  - throttling/limiting for login and reset password
