Authentication for the websockets
  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/websocket-security
  https://auth0.com/blog/auth-with-socket-io/
  http://howtonode.org/socket-io-auth


Chat -
  - curently, client sends username with chat message.
  - now, the username will just be determined based on the socket's session token.


Auth behavior, first pass
  - our room is public
  - chat is allowed only if you choose a nickname or log in
  - welcome screen (redirect here if try to access room with no nickname or auth)
  - Login should redirect to the room afterward
  - not allowed without auth:
    - DJing
      - Don't show the search bar
      - Don't show the 'click to dj' button
      - (show a message in the queue panel)
    - skip
  - auto log out after... 3 days?
  - remember me
    - what exactly does this do?
    - means that you can close the browser and stay logged in?
  - user can reset password
  - don't require logging in every day
    - I guess this means reissuing a token when the expiration gets close
    - if the browser stays open, let it keep refreshing its token (once a day would be fine)

Do next:
  - SERVER
    - for guests:
      - allowMuteStatus = true
      - showChatImages = false
    - upon logout, force reload to account for user's other tabs / browsers
    - bug: you can have a guest tab and an account tab open at the same time
      - the websocket connection just stays open
      - solution: whenever someone enters or exits, force all websockets to refresh
    - make sure the new paths are routed to nodejs from nginx
    - make sure blacklist still works
    - only allow actual karma to be given between account users
      - still allow hooting (just no karma)
  - UI
    - redirect /login to /logout if the user is logged in
    - periodically, server should client force refresh websocket connection
  - User-oriented functions
    - Playlist copy doesn't refresh the playlist view and also doesn't copy any videos

Do later:
  - periodically, server sends a new session token for people who want to leave their browser open
  - set 'secure' flag on sessionToken and configure nginx to modify the cookie on requests
  - use cookie to store a default 'room'
  - nicknames for account users
  - room admin page
  - independent auth micro-service
  - consider storing token for use in every request so that websocket connections can't be hijacked?
    - it could then not be HttpOnly...
  - throttling/limiting for login and reset password
