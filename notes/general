Architecture
  Stop using JubDJ as the conduit for inter-module communication; instead just
  inject dependencies among modules as needed

Smooth slide-out menu

Queue UX
  Final design:
    - select a track by clicking anywhere in the track's box
    - buttons appear when you select tracks
    - right-click context menu
      - delete
      - send to top



TESTING
  - nock
    - can be used like VCR, but currently breaks when trying to record/playback requests
      that include query params with spaces in them
  - INTEGRATION
    - start a jub server (may require work to make a 'test mode' for the server)
  - MODULES
    - jub_util
    - gapi
      - nock
    - jub
      - break out the business logic from the IO
      - fixtures with state
      - no sockets
    - chat
      - isolated enough
    - db
      - mockgoose
